# Python while loop.
# While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condtion is true. The syntax of while loop in python is:
"""
Initialization of a variable
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("Hello Jeremiah", number)
    number = number + 1

print("==================")
# create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop

number = 50
while number <= 70:
    print("Even number", number)
    number = number + 2


print("==================")
# Below is a decrement example that prints the multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
number = 201
while number >= 150:
        print(number)
        number = number - 3

# Research on python functions both in parameters and without parameters
# Function without parameters:
#  Used when: you don’t need user input, the task is fixed (like printing a message).



# Function with parameters
# This function accepts input(parameters) and works with it.

# Function with multiple parameters
# Function with return
# Instead of printing, it sends back a value.
